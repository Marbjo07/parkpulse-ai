ParkPulse AI is an intelligent system that utilizes AI algorithms to identify and mark parking lots on maps. The system provides a user-friendly visualization of labeled areas, accompanied by a confidence heatmap, allowing users to easily locate private parking lots. This GitHub repository contains the source code, website, models, and documentation for the ParkPulse AI project.
